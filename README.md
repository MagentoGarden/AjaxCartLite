Introduction
------------

This repository is a lite version of MagentoGarden Ajax Cart Pro extension, http://www.magentogarden.com/ajax-cart.html. 

The AJAX Cart Pro extension effectively removes those annoying page reloads that frequently occur when users click “add to cart” and “delete from cart” options. Instead of reloading, items are added instantly with appealing animation effects. This Lite Version will only contain the function for product detail page.

1. Simple product add-to-cart supported;
1. Progress animation — defines progress block position (center, top, bottom or none);
1. Cart animation — defines the cart update animation effect (opacity, grow, blink or none);

1. “Show confirmation” dialog — enables or disables pop-up dialog with product name, “Continue shopping” or “View cart & checkout” links.
